Issue with IP
    Layer 2 and 3:
        - Eavesdropping and packet sniffing
        - Allows Spoofing

General countermeasures for IP issues:
    - IP Filtering: 
    - Network Address Translation
    - VPN
    - Encrpyted IPV4 and IPV6

What is IP Filtering:
    Below are the common ways of IP filtering:

        Router can be configured to filter out packets based on:
            - IP Address (Black Listing)
            - Commonly used in Firewalls

        Port numbers:
            - Rogue protocols use multiple ports
            - E.g. stop Telnet traffic, this would have stopped the mira attack.

        Protocol Types ( TCP, UDP, ICMP)
            - Course grain filtering.
            - This would block good traffic that should be able to sent.

Network Address Translation (NAT):

    - ISP provides 1 IP but we have multiple devices.
    - The solution is to use internal address then map them to the external address
        - Common approach: 
            - Router rewrites TCP/UDP source ports to unique value per IP flow
            - Stores new source port in table with source address and old port
            - Replaces source IP Address with external address 
             
                    Private address              Public address
    [Private Network] ------------> [Nat Router] --------------> [Internet]
     
     Downside to NAT usage:
        - Not designed as a security device.
        - Does not provide security and is often coupled with a firewall.
        - So you might want to couple with a firewall to improve security 

    Internal address:
        - 10.0.0.0/8 
        - 172.16.0.0/12
        - 192.168.0.0/16

    Types: Static and Dynamic

    Static NAT:
        - One to one mapping 
        - Used with small number of machines
        - E.g. 129.186.5.100:80 -> 192.168.20.30:80
               129.186.5.101:80 -> 192.168.20.31:80
    
    Dynamic NAT:
        - More machines than static IP's
        - Used for outgoing access
        - Inside can have same address range as a valid outside network (Overlapping)
    
    Handling inbound connections:
        - Servers need a public address
            - Two network (DMZ)
            - Tunneling

            [NAT] <-> A  <-> [Router]
                  ^-> B -^
        Tunneling through a NAT
            - We can allow public internet address to a NAT Address, we can use the NAT to decided where the traffic to go.
            - Need unique address and port e.g. if two need port 80 then you need two public addresses.
            - NAT will drop packets it doesn't have in its table or sends back ICMP destination unreachable packet.

VPN (Virtual Private Network)

    Def:
        A restricted-use, logical computer network that is constructed rom the system resources of a 
        relatively public, physical network (e.g. internet), often by using encryption, and often by tunneling
        links of the virtual network across the real network [RFC2828]
    
    Used to create encrypted and authenticated communication channels (tunnels) between devices.

    Three modes:
        - Remote access client connections
        - LAN-to-LAN inter-networking (Office in belfast and dublin)
        - Controlled access within an intranet 

    Protocols:
        - PPTP: Point-to-point tunneling protocols
        - L2TP: Layer-2 tunneling Protocol
        - GRE: Generic Routing Encapsulation
        - IPsec
    
    Network to Network VPN:
        - [B] -> [Network] -> [VPN] -> [Internet] -> [VPN] -> [Network] -> [A]
    Client-to-Client VPN:
        - [Client VPN] -> internet -> [Client VPN] (Encrypted Authenticated)
                             ^- [C]
    Client-to-Network VPN:
        - Kinda a mix of Network-to-network and client-to-client.

    Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol:

        - We want to send PDU over internet.
        - the payload of PPTP PDU's are PPP packets
            [PPP]
            [GRE v.2 header]
            [IP Header]
            [MAC Layer]
        - PPP Packets are encapsulated in GRE packets that temselves are encapsulated in IP packets.
        - PPTP realizes a tunnel over the internet that carries PPP packets
    
    Compulsory tunneling:
        - PPTP is compulsory tunneling doesn't reach client pc (its point to point for them).
        - PPP at layer 2, PPTP from ISP POP.
        - Subnet security 

    Voluntary Tunneling protocol layers:
        - Extends to the client pc's
        - This gives us end-to-end security
        - End system security services 
        - This will slow down the connection

    L2TP vs PPTP:
        - Both use: 
            + PPP for user packets
            + Extends PPP by allowing layer-2 and PPP endpoints to reside on different devices
            + support voluntary and compulsory tuennling 
            + provide for header compression 

        - PPTP is consider easy to setup but has security issues: Weak encryption

        - L2TP - Offers stronger security

        
IPSec

    Overview:
        The IPSec architecture:
            - Modes: Transport or Tunnel
        IP Security Policy Database (SPD)
        Security associations (SA) and the SA Database (SADB)
        
        IPSec Security Protocols:
            - Authentication Header (AH)
            - Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
        
        Entity Authentication and the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)

    Main issue with IP:
        - Lack of source IP: Lack of Data origin authentication / Data integrity:
            + Has the packet been sent by the source?
            + Was the packet changed?
            + Is the destination correct
        
        - Confidentiality:
            + Was the packet inspected by a third party.

    Security objectives:
        Data origin Authentication / connectionless data integrity:
            + Its not possible to send an IP datagram with masqueraded IP source.
            + Its not possible to modify an IP datagram in Translation
            + Replay protection: its not possible to later replay a record packet without detection
        Confidentiality:
            + It is not possible to eavesdrop on the content of IP datagrams.

    Security Policy:
        - Setup by endpoints - What they want to protect and when.

    IP Authentication Header - Authentication and integrity of payload and header. *
    IP Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP) - Confidentiality of payload.
    ESP with optional ICV (Integrity check value) - Confidentiality, authentication and integrity of payload. *

    End-points, gateways = Can apply IPSec support.

    IPsec  architecture:
        - Concepts:
            Security association (SA), security association database (SADB)
            Security policy, security policy database
        - Fundamental IPsec Protocols:
            - Authentication Header and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
        - Models: Tunnel or Transport
        - Key Management Procedures: IKE & IKEv2

        Workflow:    
            IKEv2 needs to key exchange
            IKE SA
            IPSec SA Pair
            ESP protects data

        - Security services are provided to one SA by the use of either AH or ESP.
        - For bi-directional communication two security associations are needed
        - An SA is uniquely identified by a triple consisting of security parameter index,
          an IP destination address, and a security protocol identifier (AH/ESP)
        - An SA can be setup between the following: (Tunnel or Transport mode)
            + Host to Host
            + Host to Gateway (or vice versa)
            + Gateway to Gateway
        - There are two database associated with SAs:
            + The security policy database specifies what security services are to be provided to which IP packets and in what fashion
            + The security association database

        IPSec Security Policy Selection:
            Selectors to be extracted from the network and transport layer headers allow to select a specific policy in SPD:
                + IP source address: Specific host, network prefix, address range or wildcard.
                + IP destination address: Specific host, network prefix, address range or wildcard.
                + Protocol: The protocol identifier of the transport protocol for this packet.
                + Upper layer ports: If accessible, the upper layer ports for session oriented policy selection.
            [Match (source and dest) | Action]

        Security Association Database:
            - Algorithm, IPSec Protocol, Key, SPI this will decided what to use.  

        Transport Mode:
            - Can only be used between end-points (Host to Host or Host to Gateway)
            - Header: Transport mode just adds a security specific header (+ eventual trailer):
                      [IP Header | IPSec Header | Protected data]
            Functionality:
                - Protects upper layer protocols 
                - Includes TCP or UDP segment or an ICMP packet
                - used for End-toEnd communication
                - ESP encrypts and optionally authenticates the IP payload but not the IP header.
                - AH in transport mode authenticates the IP payload and selected portions of the IP header.

        Tunnel mode:
            - Can be used with arbitrary peer's.
            - Header: Tunnel mode encapsulates IP Packets:
                      [IP Header | IPSec header | IP Header | protected data]
            - Tunnel will allow for a gateway protecting traffic on behalf of other entities (e.g. subnet hosts)
            Functionality:
                - Protects entire IP packet
                - Used when one or both ends of a security association are security gateway.
                - Hosts can use secure communications without implementing IPsec.
                - ESP in tunnel moe encrypts and can authenticates the inner IP packet, including the inner IP header.
                - AH in tunnel mode authenticates the entire inner IP packer and selected portions of the outer IP header.

        Keys:
            - Internet Security Association Key management Protocol (ISAKMP):
                Defines generic framework for key authentication, key exchange and negotiation of security association parameters.
            - Internet key Exchange (IKE)
                Defines auth and key exchange.

        How IPSec protects against Replay:
            - Both AH and ESP-protected IP packets carry a sequence number which realizes a replay protection:
                + When setting up an SA this sequence number is init to 0.
                + The sequence number is increased with every packet.
                + The sequence number is 32 bit long and a new session key is needed before a wrap-around occurs.
                + the receiver of an IP packet checks if the sequence number is contained in a window of acceptable numbers.
                    + If a received packet has a sequence number which is:
                        - to left of current window => dropped packet.
                        - inside current window => accept packet.
                        - to right of current window => accept and advances the current window.
        
        Main integration:

            OS: 
                Application
                Transport 
                Network + IPsec
                Data links
             
            Bump in the stack:
                Application
                Transport 
                Network
                IPsec
                Data links

        or

        We can implement it at the router level:
            Advantages:
                + Ability to secure IP packets flowing between two network over a public network
                    + Allows to create VPN's 
                    + No need to integrate IPsec in every end system
                + Ability to authenticate and authorize IP traffic coming in from remote users

        When to use IPSec mode?
            Transport Mode: Cryptographic endpoints are communication endpoint.
            Tunnel Mode: one Cryptographic endpoints are not communication endpoint. (Security on behalf of others.)

     ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload):
        + Confidentiality by encrypting encapsulated packets or just their payload.
        + Data origin authentication, by creating and adding MAC's to packets.

    AH (Authentication Header):
        + Replay protection
        + Data origin authentication by creating and adding MAC's to packets.

    Issues with IPSec 
        Compression:
            - If encryption is used then the resulting IP packets can not be compressed in the link layer.
            - Therefore, the IP payload compression protocol (PCP) has been defined.
            - PCP can be used with IPsec:
                - IPsec Policy definition allows to specify PCP.
                - IKE SA negotiation allows to include PCP.
            
            Problems of end-to-end security with header processing in intermediate nodes:
                - Interoperability with firewalls:
                    - End-to-end encryption conflicts with firewalls as you are no longer able to inspected packet.
                - Interoperability with NAT
                    - Encrypted packets neither permit analysis nor change of addresses
                    - Authenticated packets will be discarded if source or dest is changed.
