Cloud - Roles and Responsibilities

    • Cloud consumer: A person or organization that maintains a business relationship with, and uses service from, cloud providers.
    • Cloud provider: A person, organization, or entity responsible for making a service available to interested parties.
    • Cloud auditor: A party that can conduct independent assessment of cloud services, information system operations, performance, 
      and security of the cloud implementation .
    • Cloud broker: An entity that manages the use, performance, and delivery of cloud services, and negotiates relationships between CPs and cloud consumers. 
    • Cloud carrier: An intermediary that provides connectivity and transport of cloud services from CPs to cloud consumers.

Network security challenges in the virtualized data center
    • Hypervisor integrity
    • A successful attack against a host’s hypervisor can compromise all of the workloads being delivered by the host.
    • Intra-host communications
    • Communications traffic between different VMs on the same physical host is often not visible and therefore cannot 
      be controlled by traditional physical firewalls and IPS
    • VM migration
    • When VMs migrate from one physical host to another or from one physical site to another they tend to break network 
      security tools that rely on physical and/or network-layer attributes

    Cloud provider responsibilities:
        • Secure underlying infrastructure and virtualization.
        • Assure security isolation between tenants.
        • Provide security capabilities for cloud users.
        • Provide attack protection mechanisms e.g. DDoS/IDS

    Cloud user responsibilities:
        • Use the security capabilities/controls offered by the cloud provider e.g.
            • security settings, such as identity management, to the virtual resources
            • Monitoring and logging
            • Image asset management
            • Dedicated hosting (i.e. network isolation)
        • Implement security controls on the virtual resource e.g. secure configuration/secure code

Incident Response
    Recommendations:
        • SLAs and setting expectations around customer versus provider responsibilities
        • Cloud customers must:
            • Set up proper communication paths with the provider that can be used in an incident
            • Understand the content and format of data that the CSP will supply for analysis and
            evaluate whether available forensic data satisfies legal chain of custody requirements
        • For each CSP, the approach to detecting and handling incidents involving the
        resources hosted at that provider must be planned and described in the enterprise
        incident response plan
        • The SLA with each CSP must guarantee support for the incident handling required for
        effective execution of the enterprise incident response plan

Cloud Security as a Service (SecaaS)

    • The Cloud Security Alliance defines SecaaS as the provision of security applications
    and services via the cloud either to cloud-based infrastructure and software or from
    the cloud to the customers’ on-premise systems

    • The Cloud Security Alliance has identified the following SecaaS categories of service:
            • Identity, entitlement, and access management services
            • Cloud access and security brokers (also known as cloud security gateways)
            • Web security gateways
            • E-mail security
            • Security assessment
            • Web application firewalls
            • Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS)
            • Security information and event management (SIEM)
            • Encryption and key management
            • Business continuity and disaster recovery
            • Security management
            • Distributed Denial of Service Protection

Cloud Security as a Service (SecaaS)
    • Recommendations:
        • Before engaging a SecaaS provider, be sure to understand any security-specific
        requirements for data-handling (and availability), investigative, and compliance support.
        • Pay particular attention to handling of regulated data, such as PII
        • Understand data retention needs – consider standard data feeds to avoid lock-in
