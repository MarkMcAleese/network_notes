Principal defense categories:
    - Prevention
    - Detection
    - Response

Examples of intrusion:
    - Remote root compromise of an e-mail server.
    - Defacing a web server.
    - Running a packet sniffer on a workstation to capture usernames and password.

Goal
    - Supervision of computer systems and communication infrastructures in order to detect intrusions and misuse.

Intrusion Detection:
    - A system's second line of defense 
    - Is based on assumption that the behavior of the intruder differs from that of a user in ways that be quantified.

Tasks:
    Audit:
        - Recording of all security relevant events of a supervised system.
        - Preprocessing and management of recorded audit data.
    Detection:
        - Automatic analysis of audit data.
        - Approaches:
            + Signature analysis.
            + Abnormal behavior Detection.
            + Anomaly Detection.
        - Types of errors:
            + False positive  : a non-malicious action is reported as an intrusion.
            + False negative : an intrusion is not detected.
    Response:
        - Reporting of detected attacks.
        - Potentially also initiating countermeasures.

Detection Quality:

Classification 

    False Alert  (False postive)        |   Detected Attack (True positive)
    Irrelevant event (True negative)    |   Unrecognized Attack (False negative)
        (Legitimate)                                (Illegitimate)
                                    Events

    Accuracy =   TP + TN
               ------------
                TP+FP+TN+FN

    Sensitivity =       TP
                    -----------
                       TP+FN

    Precision =         TP
                    -----------
                       TP+FP

Requirements of IDS:
    - High Accuracy
    - Easy to integrate into a system / network.
    - Easy to configure and maintain. 
    - Autonomous and fault tolerant operation
    - Low resource Requirements
    - Self protection
