Principal defense categories:
    - Prevention
    - Detection
    - Response

Examples of intrusion:
    - Remote root compromise of an e-mail server.
    - Defacing a web server.
    - Running a packet sniffer on a workstation to capture usernames and password.

Goal
    - Supervision of computer systems and communication infrastructures in order to detect intrusions and misuse.

Intrusion Detection:
    - A system's second line of defense 
    - Is based on assumption that the behavior of the intruder differs from that of a user in ways that be quantified.

Tasks:
    Audit:
        - Recording of all security relevant events of a supervised system.
        - Preprocessing and management of recorded audit data.
    Detection:
        - Automatic analysis of audit data.
        - Approaches:
            + Signature analysis.
            + Abnormal behavior Detection.
            + Anomaly Detection.
        - Types of errors:
            + False positive  : a non-malicious action is reported as an intrusion.
            + False negative : an intrusion is not detected.
    Response:
        - Reporting of detected attacks.
        - Potentially also initiating countermeasures.

Detection Quality:

Classification 

    False Alert  (False postive)        |   Detected Attack (True positive)
    Irrelevant event (True negative)    |   Unrecognized Attack (False negative)
        (Legitimate)                                (Illegitimate)
                                    Events

    Accuracy =   TP + TN
               ------------
                TP+FP+TN+FN

    Sensitivity =       TP
                    -----------
                       TP+FN

    Precision =         TP
                    -----------
                       TP+FP

Requirements of IDS:
    - High Accuracy
    - Easy to integrate into a system / network.
    - Easy to configure and maintain. 
    - Autonomous and fault tolerant operation
    - Low resource Requirements
    - Self protection

Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)

    - Works on information available on a system:
        + OS and application logs 
        + System files
    - Can detect attacks by insiders e.g. when files are copied to USB sticks.
    - Has to be installed on every system:
        + Hard to manage on large number of systems.
        + Not available for every platforms.
        + May be disabled by the attacker.
    - Produces lots of information.
    - Often no real-time analysis.

Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

    - Analysis of flow of information on the network.
    - Can detect invalid packets, attacks on application layers, DDoS, spoofing, port scans.
    - CAn no detect offline attacks - E.g. copying files to USB.
    - Often used on network buns to monitor a segment.

    Placement:
        - Monitors throughout the network.
        - Sends central IDS/SIEM (Sends all information to this box, find attacks that could be spread over the network)
        - Heavy overhead sending the data.
        
Signature-based Detection:
    Basic idea:
        - Some attacks will have patterns that can be described with details.
    Identifying attack signatures:
        - Analyzing vulnerability's, past attacks.
    Specifying attack signatures:
        - Based on identified knowledge, "rules" will describe the attack.
    
    
            + Easy to setup
            + In some environments acceptable false positive rate
        Disadvantages:
            - Requires prior knowledge of attacks.
            - Requires continuous updating (large database).
            - High rate of false negatives.
            - IP and TCP preprocessing requires resources
            - Possibility of bypassing

Behavior/Anomaly-based Detection:
    Basic idea
        - Detect behavior that differs significantly from normal use.
        - Users and systems have "normal" use patterns.
        - Assumption "behavior" can be described by an administrator.
        - Analysis: events, and Abnormal behavior

    Properties:
        Advantages:
            + Approach can detect unknown attacks.
            + Attacks cannot easily be prepared to avoid detection.
            + If well set up: acceptable false positive rate.
            + Events quite easy to interpret.
        Disadvantages:
            - High administrative effort.

Automatic Anomaly Detection:

 Properties:
        Advantages:
            + Can detect unknown attacks.
            + Comparability easy to setup
        Disadvantages:
            - Privacy - Pattern collection and work-related or person habits.
            - Requires continuous refreshing of normal behavior patterns.
            - High amount of false positives.
            - True positives can be difficult to interpret.
            - Normal behavior pattern matches an attack pattern, this will not be detected.


Problems with IDS:
    IDS Evasion 
        - Anomaly: Attack may act slowly, or high amount of legitimate traffic to cover an attack.
        - Signature-based IDS: Attackers may construct attack so they aren't detected.
                            Encryption only work if the IDS also has the private key.

    Audit data:
        - Amount of log data: High data volume requires storage and processing.
        - Location of data: if stored on log server has to be transfer.
                            if on the system - uses a lot of resources of the system.
        - Protection of audit data: compromised systems also means audit data is compromised.
        - Expressiveness: What is relevant, low percentage of useful information
    
    Privacy ( Data Protection ):
        - User-Identifying data are logged: User ids, names of directories, host type + time + action,
                                            access rights + time + action.
        - IDS audits may violate privacy of the user.
        - Potential solution: log activities with user pseudonyms and ensure that they can only be
                              mapped to user ids upon incident detection.
    
    Limited efficiency of analysis:
        - Most IDS follow a centralist approach for analysis: so-called agents collect audit data and one
        central evaluation unit analyzes this data. -> No partial evaluation in agents
                                                    -> Performance bottleneck.
        - Insufficient efficiency, especially concerning attack variants and attacks with parallel actions.

    High number of false positives:
        - Too many false alarms
        - Countermeasure: Alarm correlation.
    
    Further problems and open issues:
        - Self protection
        - High maintenance overhead
        - Cooperation between multiple IDS

Intrusion Prevention Systems:

    Motivation:
        - Automatic event generation insufficient: 
            -> Automatic exploitation is extremely fast
            -> Too many attacks on current systems.
        - Led to development of IPS
        - IDS systems nearly all include IPS
    
    Approaches:
        - Inline operation and suppression 
            - All traffic goes through IPS
            - Any flow that matches a attack event is suppressed
            Pros:
                + Efficient.
                + No race conditions.
            Cons:
                - Possible bottle neck and single point of failure.
                - May be difficult to set up.
        
        - Firewall reconfiguration:
            - IPS reconfigs an existing firewall to suppress suspicious flows.
            Pros and Cons:
                + Easy setup
                + No single point of failure
                - Race conditions: What if the attack already reached the network.
        
        - Send TCP-RST Packets:
            - IPS reset TCP flows by resetting the connection
            - Pro's and Con's:
                + Same pro's as above.
                - Works only for TCP.
                - Race conditions
        
        Deflection:
            - Reconfiguration of firewall and/or routers.
            - Attacker is transparently redirected to honey pots to slow down their attacks.
            + Pro's and Con's:
                + May cause significant slow down.
                - Hard to setup
                - Race conditions
        
        Honeypots:
            
            Has no production value: These are fabricated systems to make it look real.
            
            Designed to: Divert attackers from real system, collect information about the attack and 
                         Encourage the attack to stay on the system long enough.
            
            - This is a decoy systems that are designed to lure in attackers.
            - Give enough time to log and track the attacker.
            - Also build entire honeypot network that emulate an enterprise with actual or simulated traffic and data.

            Deployment:
                • Location 1: Outside external firewall to track connection attempts to unused IP addresses
                • Location 2: Within the DMZ
                • Location 3: Fully internal

            
Unified thread management:
    What is it?
        - Essentially consolidation of stateful inspection firewalls, antivirus and IPS into one application.
        - Lives between internet, firewall and the DMZ that will send logs to another server.
