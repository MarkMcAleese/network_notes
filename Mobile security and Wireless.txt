• Can you identify the main security issues with mobile devices?

    Mobile communication faces all fixed network threats -  Plus some specific issues arising out of mobility of users and / or devices:
        • Some existing threats become more dangerous:
            • Wireless communication is more accessible for eavesdropping
            • The lack of a physical connection makes it easier to access services
        • Some new difficulties for realizing security services:
            • Authentication has to be re-established when the mobile device moves
            • Key management gets harder as peer identities can not be pre-determined
        • One completely new threat:
            • The location of a device / user becomes a more important piece of information that is worthwhile to eavesdrop on and thus to protect
        Security Issues:
            - Lack of physical controls.
            - Use of not trusted mobile devices.
            - Use of not trusted networks.
            - Use of not trusted content.
            - Use of applications create by unknown parties.
            - Interaction with other systems.
            - Use of location services.

    Location privacy in mobile networks
        • The basic location privacy design problem:
            • A mobile device should be reachable
            • No (single) entity in the network should be able to track the location of a mobile device
        • Four classes of protection strategies:
            • Regulatory approaches
                • Legal rules for collecting and handling location information
            • Privacy Policies
                • Automatic ways for users to prevent certain uses of their personal data
            • Anonymity
                • Attempt to hide individuals’ identities, either by using pseudonyms or by withholding identity
                information altogether
            • Obfuscation
                • Implementing the need-to-know principle i.e. reducing information to what is
                absolutely necessary for a requested service
            
• Can you identify the main security issues with wireless devices?
    Channel
        - Wireless networking involves broadcast communications, which is far more susceptible to easvedropping and jamming.
        - Wireless network are also more vulnerable to active attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in communications protocols.
    Mobility:
        - Wireless devices are far more portable and mobile than wired devices adds more risk.
    Resources:
        - Limited amount of resources on devices.
    Accessibility:
        - Wireless devices maybe be left unattended in remote/hostile locations.
        
    Threats:
        Accidental association
            • Company wireless LANs in close proximity may create overlapping transmission ranges
            • A user intending to connect to one LAN may unintentionally lock on to a wireless access point from a neighboring network
        Malicious association
            • In this situation, a wireless device is configured to appear to be a legitimate access point, enabling the operator to steal passwords 
             from legitimate users and then penetrate a wired network through a legitimate wireless access point
        Ad hoc networks
            • These are peer-to-peer networks between wireless computers with no access point between them
            • Such networks can pose a security threat due to a lack of central point of control.
        Nontraditional networks:
            • Personal network Bluetooth devices, barcode readers, and handheld PDAs pose a security risk in terms of both eavesdropping and spoofing
        Identity theft ( MAC spoofing ):
            • This occurs when an attacker is able to eavesdrop on network traffic and identify the MAC address of a computer with network privileges
        Man-in-the-middle attacks:
            • This attack involves persuading a user and an access point to believe that they are talking to each other when in fact the communication is going through an intermediate attacking device
            • Wireless networks are particularly vulnerable to such attacks
        Denial of service ( DoS ):
            • This attack occurs when an attacker continually bombards a wireless access point or some other accessible wireless port with various protocol messages designed to consume system resources
            • The wireless environment lends itself to this type of attack because it is so easy for the attacker to direct multiple wireless messages at the target
        Network injection:
            • This attack targets wireless access points that are exposed to nonfiltered network traffic, such as routing protocol messages or network management messages

• Can you identify threats unique to the wireless network?

• Can you explain the security claims of IEEE 802.11 and the issue with these claims?
    • Security services of IEEE 802.11 were originally realized by:
        • Entity authentication service
        • Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) mechanism
    • WEP is supposed to provide the following security services:
        • Confidentiality
        • Data origin authentication / data integrity
        • Access control
    • WEP makes use of the following algorithms:
        • The RC4 stream cipher
        • The Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC) checksum for detecting errors

    The WEP has been designed to ensure the following security properties:
        • Confidentiality:
            • Only stations which possess KBSS can read messages protected with WEP
        • Data origin authentication / data integrity:
            • Malicious modifications of WEP protected messages can be detected
        • Access control in conjunction with layer management:
            • If set up, only WEP protected messages will be accepted by receivers
            • So stations that do not know KBSS can not send to such receivers
       
        • Unfortunately, none of the above claims holds... 


• Can you describe the security provided by Robust Security Network (RSN)/IEEE 802.11i?
    RSN security consists of two basic subsystems:
        • Data privacy mechanisms:
            • TKIP - rapid re-keying to patch WEP for minimum privacy (marketing name WPA)
            • AES encryption - robust data privacy for long term (marketing name WPA2)
        • Security association management:
            • Enterprise mode – based on 802.1X
                • Personal mode – based on pre-shared keys
