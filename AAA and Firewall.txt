What is access control?

    - Access control is a enforce mediation on subject requests for access to objects in a security policy.

    [Subject] -Request-> [Reference Monitor] -> Grant
                                |-> Deny
    
Network Access control

    - Access Requester
        Node that is trying to access.
    - Policy Server
        What access should be granted.
    - Network Access Server 
        Access control point, it can use its own authentication service or send it off to another service.

AAA 

    Authentication - Ensuring the identity of an entity
    Authorization  - Ensuring that an entity has permission to access.
    Accounting     - Keeping an auditable record of which entities have accessed which resources. 

Basic steps of a AAA service

    1) User sends a user ID and password to the NAS (network access server) : NAS can send this to an authentication server.
    2) The NAS collects the remote user's ID and password.
    3) The NAS sends an authentication request to the AAA server.
    4) The AAA server checks identity and return connection and authorization record.
    5) The NAS confirms connection and writes the audit record.

RADIUS
    - Remote authentication Dial-In User Service
    - Networking protocol providing centralized AAA services.

    Steps:
        1) User initiates PPP authentication to the NAS.
        2) NAS prompts for username and encrypted password or challenge authentication protocol (CHAP)
        3) User replies.
        4) RADIUS client sends username and password to RADIUS server
        5) RADIUS server responds with Accept, reject or challenge.
        6)The RADIUS client acts upon services and services parameters bundled with Accept or Reject.
    
    Accounting:
        [HOST] --------------- RADIUS client ----------------- RADIUS Server
    
Kerberos

    A network authentication protocol, this can build on what we have already seen with 
    providing strong authentication for client and servers applications.

    Effective in open distributed environments where users have a unqiue ID for each application.
    This verifies that users who they claim to be and network services they use are within their permission profile.

    Components:
        Client (User)
        Authentication server (AS)
        Ticket-granting server (TGS)
        Application server
    
    Ticket-granting server:
        This allow us to have access to many application servers at once depending on the request.

    Operation:
        Complexity added by ticket system.
    
    Steps:
        1) Request Ticket. (AS)
        2) Grant Ticket + session key. ( Ticket encrypted via TGS secret key, Session key is encrypted via requester user secret key) 
           The client can decrypt the session key and is enough to communicate with the TG. (Can authenticate itself with TGS)
        3) Request service - granting ticket. (TGS)
        4) Ticket + session key.
        5) Request service
        6) provide server authentication
    
    Issues:
        - Security depends on implementation.
        - KDC must be physically secured.
        - Can be single point of failure.
        - Key length is important: Too short -> brute force, too long -> overloads the system with computation, 
          password -> vulnerable to password guessing.
        - Need to embed kerberos system calls into any application that use system - called Kerberizing (It has to be able to work with Kerberos

Network Access Enforcement Methods:

    NAC enforcement methods:
        - IEEE 802.1X
        - Virtual local area networks (VLAN's)
        - Firewall
        - DHCP management.


IEEE 802.1X (Port Based)
    - Port based network access control -> Authenticating and authorizing devices attached to a LAN port.
    - Introduces the notion of two logical ports:
        + The uncontrolled port allows to authenticate a device (only allows this).
        + The controlled port allows an authenticated device to access LAN services.
    Roles:
        - Supplicant: requesting access.
        - Authenticator: demands that supplicant to authenticate itself.
        - Authentication Server: for verification.
    
IEEE 802.1Q (VLAN's)
    - Creating of virtual local area network.
    - Used to realize access control at the link level.
    - This will tag packets with VLAN tag. (12 bit identifier)
    - Switches ensure that packets with certain vlan id's are only delivered on certain network ports.
    - Host don't add vlan tag but instead added at first trusted switch and remove on the last trusted switch.
    
Firewalls

    Controls access to a network via the firewall (Subnet level)
    
    Can do:
        - Focus for security decisions.
        - Enforce a security policy.
        - Log internet activity.
        - Can limit exposure to security problems to one part of a network.
    Can't do:
        - A firewall cannot protect against insiders.
        - A firewall cannot protect connections that do not pass through it.
        - Can't protect against threats that aren't in the firewall.
        - A firewall cannot fully protect against viruses.
        - Cannot setup itself (Cost of operation)

    Two types of policies:
        Default deny strategy:
            - Allow only services that can be safely provided and for which there is a legitimate.
            - Deny any other services.
        Default permit strategy:
            - Permit every service that is not considered dangerous.
            - Block what you wish to block.

    Types:
        Packet Filtering -> Simple pattern to match against packets.
            + Network layer firewall
            + Acts like a normal router
            + Each packet is independent (simple rules), which makes for fast implement.
            + Only simple rules
            + Can't prevent application-specific attacks.
            + Most don't support for advanced authentication schemes.
            + Configuration can be wrong which creates security breaches.
        
        Stateful Inspection -> Matching layer 2 to layer 4, you have state information. Packets are checked, stateful is looking a flow process.
            (E.g. syn packet comes in you can see what flow process is already happen.)
            + Tracking state of connections.
            + State table => state machine describing protocol communication.
            + E.g. TCP - connection establishment, usage, termination.
            + Deals with packet streams.
            + Slower than stateless.
            + Can implement complex rules.

        Application Proxy -> Looking at application level, did packets come out of sync etc.
            What is a proxy?
                - A device that sit between hosts and to each end of the connection it looks like the dest.
                - Proxy provides a route to the host, acts like a relay.
                - PDU level: circuit level.
                - Application level proxy.
            - Proxy firewall must understand the application that is being sent through.
            - Candidate services for proxying: FTP, Telnet, DNS, SMTP, HTTP
            - Proxy servers usually run on bastion hosts
            - Proxy must understand the specific application, the service is not supported and cannot be forwarded across the firewall.
            - Tends to be more secure than packet filters.

            Disadvantage:
                - The additional processing overhead on each connection.
            
            Next-Generation Firewalls:
                - Standard capabilities of the first-generation firewalls: packet filtering, stateful, NAT, VPN etc
                - Integrated intrusion prevention: vulnerability-facing and threat-facing signatures.
                - Fully stack visibility and application identification: can enforce policy at the application layer.
                - Extra intelligence: take information from external sources to improve decisions.
                - Adaptability to the modern threat landscape: support upgrade paths for integration of new information.
                - In-Line support: minimum performance degradation or disruption.

                What is a bastion host?
                    - A computer that must be highly secured because it is more vulnerable to attacks than other hosts.
                    - Main point of contact for users processes of host.
                
                What is DMZ?
                    - A sub-network added between an external and an internal network, in order to provide an additional layer of security.



    Attacks and Counter measures:

        IP Address spoofing:
            - Countermeasure is to discard packets with an inside source address if the packet arrives an external interface
        Source routing attacks:
            - Countermeasure is to discard all packets that use this option.
        Tiny fragment attacks:
            - Countermeasure is to enforce a rule that the first fragment of a packet must contain a predefined minimum amount of the transport header.
